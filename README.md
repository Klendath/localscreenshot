# localscreenshot
Cobalt Strike CNA that adds a screenshot button to the toolbar. Saves CS window as a screenshot to the script location.

Short and simple script to keep you from leaving CS to take screenshots. Helps with organization and reporting. Yes I know there is no editing and it takes the entire window as the shot but it is meant for ease of use not full functionality. And really who wants to create an editor in outdated Java Swing?
